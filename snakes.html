        <p1> Many people in this world fear snakes and it is said that snakes are top 2 of the most 
            feared animals in the planet. Snakes can be extremely dangerous especialy if they are 
            venomous and the way they slither through the round can be both absoltely terrifying to 
            those who fear snakes and facinating to those who love snakes. It is known that some of the
            most feared snakes are the Inland Taipan, The estern diamond back raddle snake and the king cobra. All 
            3 of these snakes are known for having lethal bites that can kill an adult humans which is why people 
            fear these snakes so much. These snakes may have the most lethal bites however they will not go out of their
            way to hunt you down and inflict you with a bite, most of the time bites happen on accident wether a person 
            accidentaly stardles, accidentaly steps on or gets too close.
