        <p1> Sharks are one of the most feared animals in the ocean and respectfuly so 
            a shark can do some serious damage if it attacks and can definately kill you.
            People are scared of sharks because how they evolved. Sharks have spent a few million
             years to become the perfect aquatic predators while humans have evolved to fear predatory animals.
             Sharks are also exelent swimmers so encountering one can be really dangerous especially out at sea.
             Although sharks can be deadly they are also Missunderstood, Many sharks species are curious animals and most 
             times will simply swim around people and not harm them. However the three sharks you should really look out for 
             are the Great White sharks, the tiger sharks and the bull sharks since they are known for being pretty hostile when
             provoked and have had the most attacks over all the other shark species. Its important to remember that these sharks 
             live far in the ocean so you don't have to worry about seeing them unless you go into out into an ocean where they are known 
             to live in.
