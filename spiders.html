        <p1> Spiders are one of the most scary looking animals/ creatures on the planet, Spiders 
            are problably the most feared animals in the world. These animals have been able to easily be 
            billions of peoples worst nightmares that a phrase was invented specifially for someone who has 
            a fear of spiders called "Arachnophobia". Spiders can be very deadly because they can inflict a painful bite 
            and with their 8 legs can easily climb up absoluely anything you can think of. Some spiders are feared because
            of their venom and have built a reputation of death itself. The 3 most feared spider species are Funnel-Web Spiders, Black Widow 
            Spiders and Redback spiders. These spiders do have vey lethal bites with the venom they inflict but again like a lot of feared animals
            these spiders are not out to hunt for humans. Spiders are one of the most important animals in the world because they bring balance 
            to an unstable ecosystem and feed on insects that are harmful to crops and livestock. As long as you simply keep your distance and don't 
            interaact with a spider especially out in the wild then you have nothing to worry about.
